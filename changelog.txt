Version 0.1.0

- Restructured packages. Instead of data.scripts.* it is now videolib.* to be more identifiable

- New feature: AutoTexProjector class
    A texture override class designed to run permanently while the game is running for things like animated portraits and illustrations.
    Decoder keeps file handle open indefinitely
    Has a frame timeout of 2 frames; if the texture is not bound then it will go dormant.
    Data driven; see settings.json and the corresponding portrait file for an example usage
    You can get a handle on it via VideoPaths.getAutoTexProjectorOverride(key in the settings.json) if you want to pause it or change the video it uses
