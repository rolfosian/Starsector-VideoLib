Version 0.1.0

- Restructured packages. Instead of data.scripts.* it is now videolib.* to be more identifiable

- New feature: AutoTexProjector class
    A texture override class designed to run permanently while the game is running for things like animated portraits and illustrations.
    Decoder keeps file handle open indefinitely
    Has a frame timeout of 2 frames; if the texture is not bound then it will go dormant.
    Data driven; see settings.json and the corresponding portrait file for an example usage
    You can get a handle on it via VideoPaths.getAutoTexProjectorOverride(key in the settings.json) if you want to pause it or change the video it uses

- Added changelog
- Added version files
- Added actual play/pause/stop "icons" to buttons on control panel
- Added an animated gif portrait for an AutoTexProjector example

- Changed everything to just use RGBA frames instead of selectively using RGBA/RGB24 as simple grug fix for alignment/padding errors resulting from videos with wacky resolutions
- Refactored and cleaned up frame buffer handling

- Fixed freeze related to seeking to end on video player control panel
- Fixed texture uploads rendering upside down without postprocessing
- Fixed crash related to GL unpack alignment when uploading textures with a funky resolution to gpu
- "Fixed" audio drifting progressively behind video on linux (Works on my machine™)

Version 0.1.1

- Added options for AutoTexProjector instantiation to give control over whether or not video frames update for textures during CombatEngine pause
    See "campaignRunWhilePaused" and "combatRunWhilePaused" keys in example in settings.json. Defaults to true if not set.

- Various minor AutoTexProjector optimizations
- AutoTexProjectors will now use groups of 50 decoders per thread (maximum can be adjusted in settings.json)
    Previously they used a thread for each individual decoder which resulted in many threads competing for java stack heap and used a ton of internal JVM memory.
    If there was not much JVM heap headroom it also incurred a non-trivial "juggle" churning cost on the CPU.
    This results in a much faster startup time and major reduction in heap usage.

- Reduced AutoTexProjector timeout to 1 frame if its texture is not being rendered
- New GroupedMuteDecoder class RGBATextureBuffer maximum capacity 3 decoded video frames down from 5 (The VideoFrames in system memory, pre-upload to GPU)

- Fixed a minor AutoTexProjector manual control bug
- Renamed some FFmpeg JNI bindings to something more appropriate
- Added an FFmpeg JNI method to (very roughly) estimate passive memory usage of an open FFmpegVideoLibContext struct (i wouldnt trust it tbh)

Version 0.1.1a

- Added a missing (redundant) method for AutoTexProjector that should have been implemented but wasn't
- Fixed a bug with AutoTexProjector changeVideo method where the startUs parameter was ignored
- Fixed a bug with AutoTexProjector setRunWhilePaused method where it had an incorrect signature
- Fixed wrong load op for AutoTexProjector instantiator var6 for the new op that resulted in intermittent JVM hotspot verification failure for the instantiator class
- Some groundwork for audio support for AutoTexProjector (lol), changed MuteDecoderGroup to inherit from abstract class DecoderGroup, moved related classes to "group" sub-package of decoder package
